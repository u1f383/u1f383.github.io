I'm Pumpkin (@u1f383), is a security researcher at DEVCORE, focusing on Linux kernel security now.

The following slides are from my talks. I hope you find them useful 🙂.
- [[POC 2024] How I use a novel approach to exploit a limited OOB on Ubuntu at Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024](/slides/talks/2024_POC-How_I_use_a_novel_approach_to_exploit_a_limited_OOB_on_Ubuntu_at_Pwn2Own_Vancouver_2024.pdf) (English, uploaded on November 13, 2024)


I also participate in some study groups and will occasionally share some slides here that might be useful (most of them are written in Traditional Chinese, haha).
